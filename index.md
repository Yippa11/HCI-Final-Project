## Design Manifesto

### Human Computer Interaction

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a mix of both computer science and design aspects. It allows people to design and build effective programs that take the user's experience into perspective in the process. In D-Term of 2018 I took a Human-Computer Interaction course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in that course I explored the basics of HCI through six design projects.  Throughout the course I learned a lot about the process behind designing applications and how certain choices can affect the user's experience.  The projects were carried out in teams of 3 or 4 students and covered a wide variety of design topics that expanded my knowledge of the process as a whole.  For each project the team documented every decision we made from the brainstorming to putting together a final product. Some important parts of the process that I picked up on along the way are talked about below
