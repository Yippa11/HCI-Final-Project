## Design Manifesto

### Human Computer Interaction

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a mix of both computer science and design aspects. It allows people to design and build effective programs that take the user's experience into perspective in the process. In D-Term of 2018 I took a Human-Computer Interaction course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in that course I explored the basics of HCI through six design projects.  Throughout the course I learned a lot about the process behind designing applications and how certain choices can affect the user's experience.  The projects were carried out in teams of 3 or 4 students and covered a wide variety of design topics that expanded my knowledge of the process as a whole.  For each project the team documented every decision we made from the brainstorming to putting together a final product. Some important parts of the process that I picked up on along the way are talked about below

### Brainstorming

The first task in each of our projects was for the team to get together and brainstorm ideas on where to take the project based on the assignment.  In the reading [The Design of Everyday Things](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/reading/DesignThinking_DonNorman.pdf) the the first phase of the design process is to find the problem to solve. Initially the projects had stricter guidlines and we knew exactly what problem we were trying to solve, but as the term went on the projects became more open ended and required us to find a problem to solve. An example of a brainstorming list for the [Design for Another World](https://medium.com/@lukeypsilantis/design-for-another-world-6487db2ae039) can be seen below:

In this brainstorming step, group members would come up with any ideas they had without really thinking of how practical it would be to implement them in order to keep from narrowing our scope too soon in the process. The goal of brainstorming is simply to generate as many ideas as possible, so we can find one that will work.
			
Much of our brainstorming were bulleted lists of ideas that often had accompanying sketches, and even though the final product rarely resembled the brainstorming sheet, it was very useful to get the ideas down on paper.  For some projects the brainstroming stage was quite difficult due to either the topic of the assignment or just to the fact that my group as a whole were having some trouble being creative.

In the [Design for Understanding](https://medium.com/@ezhou/design-for-understanding-weather-83251b084245) project much of our brainstorming included drawing different types of graphs as we had to display data in both a creative and straightforeward manner. Being able to sketch out these designs before hand helped us get a good sense of what types of graphs worked and didn't work for our needs.

### Background Research

After being assigned many [readings](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/schedule.html#tue-313--need-finding--task-analysis) addressing need finding, it was apparent that knowing what the user wants is an integral part of the design process.  Doing research online about similar problems as well as asking our peers was very helpful in the design process. Research is important because if we did not use our outside sources we might end up designing an application that users do not find useful even if we had thought so.

### Prototyping

Prototyping is another important step in the design process because it helps to show the team if our idea is actually capable of solving the problem at hand, and also seeing if the application runs as intended. In one of our readings on prototyping we learned that first attempts at building applications are almost always wrong and it will take multiple attempts to get to where we want. Prototyping allows the programmer to observe how users interact with their application, and to see if their initial designs were a good idea or not. There are many different types of prototyping that we can utilize in the design process that allow us to carry out tests without having to put in the time and effort required for a final version.  An example fo this was in [Design for Tension](https://medium.com/design-for-tension/design-for-tension-designing-a-chat-box-for-friends-of-depressed-people-4275612161d) our group mapped out all the repsonse paths for our chatbot to take based on the user inputs to the conversation:

### 4. User Testing
            
In my experience, user testing is perhaps the most important and useful point of the design process. Seeing how users interact with the application is very important because it allows us to find out where our problems lie, and based on their feedback we can go revise the application to better serve its purpose. New perspectives can be brought up that no one on the team might have come up with during our meetings.vBefore demo day, I showed my applications to some of my friends and roomates as a way to get initial feedback before the final version was due. Demo days were a great place to get feedback from user testing because many people in our class would get a chance to use the application right in front of us.
			
Here are the videos of applications being demoed:

During my first round of testing for [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-wellbeing-394db54501da), my group found that users were confused by the loading period while the Affectiva program recognized their face. To remedy this we added in a loading screen to the [final version](http://josephpetitti.com/hci-project5) to help solve this issue. This was a great example of how using user testing helped our team improve our application for the better.
			
### Implementing Feedback
			
While getting all the feedback from the testing and from demo days is very useful, an important part of the process is taking that feedback and imprving our application from it. Since we started the next project right after submitting, there was not time to spend on revising our final product. However we were able to write about changes we could have made given more time.  In the conclusions of our design documents we would discuss the feedback we recieved and possible solutions to the problems that had arisen.

### Conclusion

After taking CS 3041 Human-Computer Interaction, I have learned that the design process is a very important tool that is not only useful for designing applications on a computer, but it can be translated to almost any other project I tackle throughout the rest of my live. I learned about the importance of brainstorming and really thinking about the user rather than just the application itself. I also improved my skills at working in a small team environment on a short time schedule as well as opening up to being more creative in my ideas. Human-Computer Interaction is an integral part of being a computer scienctist and this course has given me valuble knowledge that I hope to retain over the years.

### About Me

My name is Luke Ypsilantis and I am currently a softmore computer science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I enjoy many aspects of design so being able to take a course on Human-Computer Interaction was a great opportunity for me. Outside of school I like to spend my time outdoors as much as possible whether it is hiking in the White Mountains in New Hampshire like I used to do in Boy Scouts, or driving down to Cape Cod, MA to be by the ocean. Sports have been a very large part of my life as well. I played both soccer and basketball my whole life as well as trying out many other sports along the way.  I am currently on WPI's Mens A Team for Ultimate Frissbee which I have come to enjoy after learning about the sport when I came to college.
