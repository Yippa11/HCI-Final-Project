## Design Manifesto

### Human Computer Interaction

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a mix of both computer science and design aspects. It allows people to design and build effective programs that take the user's experience into perspective in the process. In D-Term of 2018 I took a Human-Computer Interaction course at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in that course I explored the basics of HCI through six design projects.  Throughout the course I learned a lot about the process behind designing applications and how certain choices can affect the user's experience.  The projects were carried out in teams of 3 or 4 students and covered a wide variety of design topics that expanded my knowledge of the process as a whole.  For each project the team documented every decision we made from the brainstorming to putting together a final product. Some important parts of the process that I picked up on along the way are talked about below

### Brainstorming

The first task in each of our projects was for the team to get together and brainstorm ideas on where to take the project based on the assignment.  In the reading [The Design of Everyday Things](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/reading/DesignThinking_DonNorman.pdf) the the first phase of the design process is to find the problem to solve. Initially the projects had stricter guidlines and we knew exactly what problem we were trying to solve, but as the term went on the projects became more open ended and required us to find a problem to solve. An example of a brainstorming list for the [Design for Another World](https://medium.com/@lukeypsilantis/design-for-another-world-6487db2ae039) can be seen below:

In this brainstorming step, group members would come up with any ideas they had without really thinking of how practical it would be to implement them in order to keep from narrowing our scope too soon in the process. The goal of brainstorming is simply to generate as many ideas as possible, so we can find one that will work.
			
Much of our brainstorming were bulleted lists of ideas that often had accompanying sketches, and even though the final product rarely resembled the brainstorming sheet, it was very useful to get the ideas down on paper.  For some projects the brainstroming stage was quite difficult due to either the topic of the assignment or just to the fact that my group as a whole were having some trouble being creative.

In the [Design for Understanding](https://medium.com/@ezhou/design-for-understanding-weather-83251b084245) project much of our brainstorming included drawing different types of graphs as we had to display data in both a creative and straightforeward manner. Being able to sketch out these designs before hand helped us get a good sense of what types of graphs worked and didn't work for our needs.

### Background Research

After being assigned many [readings](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/schedule.html#tue-313--need-finding--task-analysis) addressing need finding, it was apparent that knowing what the user wants is an integral part of the design process.  Doing research online about similar problems as well as asking our peers was very helpful in the design process. Research is important because if we did not use our outside sources we might end up designing an application that users do not find useful even if we had thought so.
